Our species is *Pekania pennanti*, The Fisher

**Spencer's Favorite Species:** My favorite species is *Ursus arctos*, the Brown Bear. I just think everything about them is fascinating. They've got one of the strongest senses of smell on the planet (in terms of effective range), they're super intelligent and unbelievably strong, and they're really cute and fuzzy. Frankly, there's nothing about them I don't like, they're just the best, and it's a real shame that there numbers and range have been going down over time because of human actions.

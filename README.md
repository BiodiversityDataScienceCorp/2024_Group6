**Spencer's Favorite Species:** My favorite species is *Ursus arctos*, the Brown Bear. I just think everything about them is fascinating. They've got one of the strongest senses of smell on the planet (in terms of effective range), they're super intelligent and unbelievably strong, and they're really cute and fuzzy. Frankly, there's nothing about them I don't like, they're just the best, and it's a real shame that there numbers and range have been going down over time because of human actions.

**Ashley's Favorite Species:** My favorite species is the *Provica capensis*, commonly known as the rock hyrax. Rock hyraxes are small, stub-tailed, and rabbit-like. They are mammals and their closest living relatives are elephants. These animals can be found on the continents of Asia and Africa and like to live in arid areas with many rocks and cavities. My favorite thing about them is their interesting behavior known as "hyraceum." Hyraxes constantly urinate in the same place, which are known as latrines. Their urine contains lots of calcium carbonate so it turns their latrines a white color. Hyraceum is the product of the excrement in the latrines after it has been aged.

**Rian's Favorite Species:** My favorite species is the *Onorhynchus mykiss*, also known as the Rainbow Trout. These are common fish native to tributaries on the pacific coast. These are a cold water fish, and while being native to the pacific, they can be found in every continent but Antarctica. These are not endangered fish, in fact, are sometimes considered invasive, and are often stocked into rivers and streams for sport fishing. They are such a fascinating fish because they are extremely intelligent, for a fish. They are known to avoid fisherman and are notoriously difficult to catch due to their intuition. I love them because they are a beautiful rainbow color, and they are a very fun fish to catch and eat.
